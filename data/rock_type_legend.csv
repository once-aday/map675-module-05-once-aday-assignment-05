0,basalt,"Basalt is a mafic extrusive igneous rock formed from the rapid cooling of lava rich in magnesium and iron[5] exposed at or very near the surface of a terrestrial planet or a moon.[6] More than 90% of all volcanic rock on Earth is basalt,[7] and the eruption of basalt lava is observed by geologists at about 20 volcanoes per year.[8]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basalt,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basalt#/media/File:Szentgy%C3%B6rgyhegy03.jpg
1,mixed lithologies,"The lithology of a rock unit is a description of its physical characteristics visible at outcrop, in hand or core samples, or with low magnification microscopy. Physical characteristics include colour, texture, grain size, and composition.[1][2][3] Lithology may refer to either a detailed description of these characteristics, or a summary of the gross physical character of a rock. Examples of lithologies in the second sense include sandstone, slate, basalt, or limestone.[4]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithology,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/SEUtahStrat.JPG/1920px-SEUtahStrat.JPG

3,slope mudstone,"Mudstone, a type of mudrock, is a fine-grained sedimentary rock whose original constituents were clays or muds. Mudstone is distinguished from shale by its lack of fissility (parallel layering).[1][2]

The term mudstone is also used to describe carbonate rocks (limestone or dolomite) that are composed predominantly of carbonate mud.[3] However, in most contexts, the term refers to siliciclastic mudstone, composed mostly of silicate minerals.[2]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mudstone,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/East_Beach_1_2006.JPG/1280px-East_Beach_1_2006.JPG
4,shelf sandstone,"Sandstone is a clastic sedimentary rock composed mainly of sand-sized (0.0625 to 2 mm) mineral particles or rock fragments (clasts) or organic material. They make up about 20 to 25 percent of all sedimentary rocks.[1]

Most sandstone is composed of quartz or feldspar (both silicates) because they are the most resistant minerals to weathering processes at the Earth's surface, as seen in the Goldich dissolution series. Like uncemented sand, sandstone may be any color due to impurities within the minerals, but the most common colors are tan, brown, yellow, red, grey, pink, white, and black. Since sandstone beds often form highly visible cliffs and other topographic features, certain colors of sandstone have been strongly identified with certain regions.

Rock formations that are primarily composed of sandstone usually allow the percolation of water and other fluids and are porous enough to store large quantities, making them valuable aquifers and petroleum reservoirs. Fine-grained aquifers, such as sandstones, are better able to filter out pollutants from the surface than are rocks with cracks and crevices, such as limestone or other rocks fractured by seismic activity.

Quartz-bearing sandstone can be changed into quartzite through metamorphism, usually related to tectonic compression within orogenic belts.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandstone,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/MoabAlcove.JPG/1280px-MoabAlcove.JPG

8,andesite,"Andesite ( /ˈændɪsaɪt/ or /ˈændɪzaɪt/[1]) is an extrusive igneous volcanic rock of intermediate composition, with aphanitic to porphyritic texture. In a general sense, it is the intermediate type between basalt and rhyolite, and ranges from 57 to 63% silicon dioxide (SiO2) as illustrated in TAS diagrams. The mineral assemblage is typically dominated by plagioclase plus pyroxene or hornblende. Magnetite, zircon, apatite, ilmenite, biotite, and garnet are common accessory minerals.[2] Alkali feldspar may be present in minor amounts. The quartz-feldspar abundances in andesite and other volcanic rocks are illustrated in QAPF diagrams.

Classification of andesites may be refined according to the most abundant phenocryst. Example: hornblende-phyric andesite, if hornblende is the principal accessory mineral.

Andesite can be considered as the extrusive equivalent of plutonic diorite. Characteristic of subduction zones, andesite represents the dominant rock type in island arcs. The average composition of the continental crust is andesitic.[3] Along with basalts they are a major component of the Martian crust.[4] The name andesite is derived from the Andes mountain range.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andesite,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/Zarnov.jpg
9,dacite,"Dacite ( /ˈdeɪsaɪt/) is an igneous, volcanic rock. It has an aphanitic to porphyritic texture and is intermediate in composition between andesite and rhyolite. The word dacite comes from Dacia, a province of the Roman Empire which lay between the Danube River and Carpathian Mountains (now modern Romania and Moldova) where the rock was first described.

The term dacite was introduced in the scientific literature by the Austrian geologist Guido Stache, and used for the first time in the book Geologie Siebenbürgens (The Geology of Transylvania)[1]. The reason to designate a new igneous rock type was to discriminate between the oligoclase-bearing rocks (dacites) and the orthoclase-bearing rocks (rhyolites) on petrographic grounds. The type-locality of dacite is near the village of Poieni, Cluj(Gizella quarry) located along the Crișul Repede river, Vlădeasa Massif in the northern Apuseni Mountains, Romania.[2]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dacite,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/Mineraly.sk_-_dacit.jpg
10,felsic composition lithologies,"In geology, felsic is an adjective describing igneous rocks that are relatively rich in elements that form feldspar and quartz.[1] It is contrasted with mafic rocks, which are relatively richer in magnesium and iron. Felsic refers to silicate minerals, magma, and rocks which are enriched in the lighter elements such as silicon, oxygen, aluminium, sodium, and potassium. Felsic magma or lava is higher in viscosity than mafic magma/lava.

Felsic rocks are usually light in color and have specific gravities less than 3. The most common felsic rock is granite. Common felsic minerals include quartz, muscovite, orthoclase, and the sodium-rich plagioclase feldspars (albite-rich).",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felsic,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/RhyoliteUSGOV.jpg
11,greenstone,"Greenstone is a common generic term for valuable, green-hued minerals and metamorphosed igneous rocks and stones which early cultures used in the fashioning of hardstone carvings such as jewelry, statuettes, ritual tools, and various other artifacts. Greenstone artifacts may be made of greenschist, chlorastrolite, serpentine, omphacite, chrysoprase, olivine, nephrite, chloromelanite among other green-hued minerals.[1] The term also includes jade and jadeite, although these are perhaps more frequently identified by these latter terms.[2] The greenish hue of these rocks generally derives from the presence of minerals such as chlorite, hornblende, or epidote.[3]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenstone_(archaeology),https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/Se%C3%B1or_de_las_limas_2.jpg
12,chert,"Chert ( /ˈtʃɜːrt/) is a hard, fine-grained sedimentary rock composed of microcrystalline (or cryptocrystalline) crystals of quartz,[1] the mineral form of silicon dioxide (SiO2).[2] Chert is characteristically of biological origin but may also occur inorganically as a chemical precipitate or a diagenetic replacement, as in petrified wood.[3]

Chert is typically composed of the petrified remains of siliceous ooze, the biogenic sediment that covers large areas of the deep ocean floor, and which contains the silicon skeletal remains of diatoms, silicoflagellates, and radiolarians. Depending on its origin, it can contain either microfossils, small macrofossils, or both. It varies greatly in color (from white to black), but most often manifests as gray, brown, grayish brown and light green to rusty red (occasionally dark green too); its color is an expression of trace elements present in the rock, and both red and green are most often related to traces of iron (in its oxidized and reduced forms respectively).",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chert,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a3/Tung_Ping_Chau_6.jpg
13,serpentinite,"Serpentinite is a rock composed of one or more serpentine group minerals, the name originating from the similarity of the texture of the rock to that of the skin of a snake.[1] Minerals in this group, which are rich in magnesium and water, light to dark green, greasy looking and slippery feeling, are formed by serpentinization, a hydration and metamorphic transformation of ultramafic rock from the Earth's mantle. The mineral alteration is particularly important at the sea floor at tectonic plate boundaries.[2]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serpentinite,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/Serpentinite_sur_gneiss.jpg
14,mafic composition lithologies,"Mafic is an adjective describing a silicate mineral or igneous rock that is rich in magnesium and iron, and is thus a portmanteau of magnesium and ferric.[1] Most mafic minerals are dark in color, and common rock-forming mafic minerals include olivine, pyroxene, amphibole, and biotite. Common mafic rocks include basalt, diabase and gabbro. Mafic rocks often also contain calcium-rich varieties of plagioclase feldspar. Mafic materials can also be described as ferromagnesian.

Chemically, mafic rocks are enriched in iron, magnesium and calcium and typically dark in color. In contrast the felsic rocks are typically light in color and enriched in aluminium and silicon along with potassium and sodium. The mafic rocks also typically have a higher density than felsic rocks. The term roughly corresponds to the older basic rock class.

Mafic lava, before cooling, has a low viscosity, in comparison with felsic lava, due to the lower silica content in mafic magma. Water and other volatiles can more easily and gradually escape from mafic lava. As a result, eruptions of volcanoes made of mafic lavas are less explosively violent than felsic-lava eruptions.[2] Most mafic-lava volcanoes are shield volcanoes, like those in Hawaii.[citation needed]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafic,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/BasaltUSGOV.jpg

22,conglomerate,"Conglomerate (/kənˈɡlɒmərɪt/) is a clastic sedimentary rock that is composed of a substantial fraction of rounded to subangular gravel-size clasts. A conglomerate typically contain a matrix of finer grained sediments, such as sand, silt, or clay, which fills the interstices between the clasts. The clasts and matrix are typically cemented by calcium carbonate, iron oxide, silica, or hardened clay.

Conglomerates form by the consolidation and lithification of gravel. They can be found in sedimentary rock sequences of all ages but probably make up less than 1 percent by weight of all sedimentary rocks. In terms of origin and depositional mechanisms, they are closely related to sandstones and exhibit many of the same types of sedimentary structures, e.g., tabular and trough cross-bedding and graded bedding.[1][2][3]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conglomerate_(geology),https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/Conglomerate_Death_Valley_NP.jpg

27,tuffaceous sedimentary rocks,"Tuff (from the Italian tufo), also known as volcanic tuff, is a type of rock made of volcanic ash ejected from a vent during a volcanic eruption. Following ejection and deposition, the ash is compacted into a solid rock in a process called consolidation. Rock that contains greater than 50% tuff is considered tuffaceous.

Tuff is a relatively soft rock, so it has been used for construction since ancient times. Because it is common in Italy, the Romans used it often for construction. The Rapa Nui people used it to make most of the moai statues in Easter Island. Tuff is sometimes erroneously called ""tufa"", particularly when used as construction material, but geologically tufa is a limestone precipitated from groundwater.

Tuff can be classified as either sedimentary or igneous rock. It is usually studied in the context of igneous petrology, although it is sometimes described using sedimentological terms.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuff,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Tufo_Necropoli_della_Banditaccia.JPG
34,marble,"Marble is a metamorphic rock composed of recrystallized carbonate minerals, most commonly calcite or dolomite. Marble is typically not foliated, although there are exceptions.

44,schist,"Schist (pronounced /ʃɪst/ SHIST) is a medium-grade metamorphic rock formed from mudstone or shale.[1] Schist has medium to large, flat, sheet-like grains in a preferred orientation (nearby grains are roughly parallel). It is defined by having more than 50% platy and elongated minerals (such as micas or talc),[2] often finely interleaved with quartz and feldspar.[3] These lamellar (flat, planar) minerals include micas, chlorite, talc, hornblende, graphite, and others. Quartz often occurs in drawn-out grains to such an extent that a particular form called quartz schist is produced. Schist is often garnetiferous. Schist forms at a higher temperature and has larger grains than phyllite.[4] Geological foliation (metamorphic arrangement in layers) with medium to large grained flakes in a preferred sheetlike orientation is called schistosity.[4]

The names of various schists are derived from their mineral constituents. For example, schists primarily composed of biotite and muscovite are called mica schists.[1][5] Most schists are mica schists, but graphite and chlorite schists are also common. Schists are also named for their prominent or perhaps unusual mineral constituents, as in the case of garnet schist, tourmaline schist, and glaucophane schist.

The individual mineral grains in schist, drawn out into flaky scales by heat and pressure, can be seen with the naked eye. Schist is characteristically foliated, meaning that the individual mineral grains split off easily into flakes or slabs. The word schist is derived ultimately from the Greek word σχίζειν (schízein) meaning ""to split"",[6] which is a reference to the ease with which schists can be split along the plane in which the platy minerals lie.

Most schists are derived from clays and muds that have passed through a series of metamorphic processes involving the production of shales, slates and phyllites as intermediate steps. Certain schists are derived from fine-grained igneous rocks such as basalts and tuffs.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schist,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9b/NY-Central-Park-Rock-7333.jpg
47,amphibolite,"Amphibolite ( /æmˈfɪbəlaɪt/) is a metamorphic rock that contains amphibole, especially hornblende and actinolite, as well as plagioclase.

Amphibolite is a grouping of rocks composed mainly of amphibole and plagioclase feldspar, with little or no quartz. It is typically dark-colored and dense, with a weakly foliated or schistose (flaky) structure. The small flakes of black and white in the rock often give it a salt-and-pepper appearance.

Amphibolite need not be derived from metamorphosed mafic rocks. Because metamorphism creates minerals entirely based upon the chemistry of the protolith, certain 'dirty marls' and volcanic sediments may actually metamorphose to an amphibolite assemblage. Deposits containing dolomite and siderite also readily yield amphibolite (tremolite-schist, grunerite-schist, and others) especially where there has been a certain amount of contact metamorphism by adjacent granitic masses. Metamorphosed basalt creates ortho-amphibolite and other chemically appropriate lithologies create para-amphibolite.

Tremolite, while it is a metamorphic amphibole, is derived most usually from highly metamorphosed ultramafic rocks, and thus tremolite-talc schist is not generally considered as 'amphibolite'. A holocrystalline plutonic igneous rock composed primarily of hornblende amphibole is called a hornblendite, which is usually a crystal cumulate rock. Igneous rocks with >90% amphiboles, which have a feldspar groundmass, may be a lamprophyre.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphibolite,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/Amphibolit.jpg
50,gneiss,Gneiss (/ˈnaɪs/) is a common and widely distributed type of metamorphic rock. Gneiss is formed by high temperature and high-pressure metamorphic processes acting on formations composed of igneous or sedimentary rocks. Orthogneiss is gneiss derived from igneous rock (such as granite). Paragneiss is gneiss derived from sedimentary rock (such as sandstone). Gneiss forms at higher temperatures and pressures than schist. Gneiss nearly always shows a banded texture characterized by alternating darker and lighter colored bands and without a distinct foliation.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gneiss,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/Gneiss.jpg
51,hornfels,"Hornfels is the group name for a set of contact metamorphic rocks that have been baked and hardened by the heat of intrusive igneous masses and have been rendered massive, hard, splintery, and in some cases exceedingly tough and durable. These properties are due to fine grained non-aligned crystals with platy or prismatic habits, characteristic of metamorphism at high temperature but without accompanying deformation.[1][2][3] The term is derived from the German word Hornfels, meaning ""hornstone"", because of its exceptional toughness and texture both reminiscent of animal horns. These rocks were referred to by miners in northern England as whetstones.[4][5]

Most hornfels are fine-grained, and while the original rocks (such as sandstone, shale, slate and limestone) may have been more or less fissile owing to the presence of bedding or cleavage planes, this structure is effaced or rendered inoperative in the hornfels. Though many hornfels show vestiges of the original bedding,[1] they break across this as readily as along it; in fact, they tend to separate into cubical fragments rather than into thin plates. Sheet minerals may be abundant but are aligned at random.[6]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hornfels,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/Hornfels.jpg
52,metamorphic rocks,"Metamorphic rocks arise from the transformation of existing rock types, in a process called metamorphism, which means ""change in form"".[1] The original rock (protolith) is subjected to heat (temperatures greater than 150 to 200 °C) and pressure (100 megapascals (1,000 bar) or more), causing profound physical or chemical change. The protolith may be a sedimentary, igneous, or existing metamorphic rock.

Metamorphic rocks make up a large part of the Earth's crust and form 12% of the Earth's land surface.[2] They are classified by texture and by chemical and mineral assemblage (metamorphic facies). They may be formed simply by being deep beneath the Earth's surface, subjected to high temperatures and the great pressure of the rock layers above it. They can form from tectonic processes such as continental collisions, which cause horizontal pressure, friction and distortion. They are also formed when rock is heated by the intrusion of hot molten rock called magma from the Earth's interior. The study of metamorphic rocks (now exposed at the Earth's surface following erosion and uplift) provides information about the temperatures and pressures that occur at great depths within the Earth's crust. Some examples of metamorphic rocks are gneiss, slate, marble, schist, and quartzite.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamorphic_rock,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/Migma_ss_2006.jpg
